 Exercise 1:
 Given the following dataset: vehicles.csv as well as the supporting file vehicles.names, find the
 five most important weighted coefficients and print their names (drop the make column from
 the data frame). The target variable is mpg.

 Exercise 2:
 Based on the five most important features from Ex. 1, create a 6D plot with mpg being
 assigned to markercolor.

 Exercise 3:
 Predict the mpg given the following unscaled data point: 6, 163, 111, 3.9, 2.77, 16.45, 0, 1, 4, 4.
